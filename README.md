The following code demonstrates the process of encrypting and decrypting a message using an Ethereum account and the Fernet encryption algorithm.

1. Ethereum Account Generation:
   - Generate a new Ethereum account using `eth_account.Account.create()`.
   - Obtain the private key from the generated account.

2. Key Derivation:
   - Derive a symmetric encryption key from the Ethereum private key using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2).
   - Choose a salt value and set the number of iterations for the KDF.
   - Use the `cryptography.hazmat` module to perform the key derivation.

3. Key Encoding:
   - Encode the derived key to base64 using `base64.urlsafe_b64encode()` to ensure compatibility with the Fernet encryption algorithm.

4. Encryption:
   - Prepare the message to be encrypted.
   - Create a Fernet cipher suite using the encoded key.
   - Encrypt the message using `cipher_suite.encrypt(message.encode())`.

5. Decryption:
   - Create a new Fernet cipher suite using the encoded key.
   - Decrypt the encrypted message using `cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_message)`.

**Note:** The code can be further expanded and modified as per specific requirements, such as incorporating error handling, secure storage of private keys, and appropriate choice of cryptographic parameters.

Please ensure you follow best practices for key management and security when working with sensitive data.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to meet your specific needs and requirements.
